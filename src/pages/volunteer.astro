<p>Are you feeling powerless when someone tells you to call your representative or senator? Living in DC, we've got no voice in the U.S. Congress.
</p>
<p>
Herd on the Hill was started in February 2017 to give you and other DC residents a voice by letting you help people outside DC get their Members of Congress to listen to them. So many Members of Congress are refusing to hold town halls, not answering their phones, and letting voice mailboxes fill up.
</p>
<p>
Herd on the Hill volunteers use their proximity to congressional offices in DC to work around these barriers to get Americans' views directly in front of their elected officials.
