How to Write a Good Letter to a Member of Congress Using HerdOnTheHill.com

### Q: What will automatically be included in my letter?
A: Your Senator's name and address, your name and return address, the salutation and closing, and a request that you get a reply to your letter.

### Q: Where do I start?
A: The best letters are:
- concise 
- polite 
- personalized

NOTE: The most powerful part of your letter is explaining how the Senator's vote affects you, your loved ones, and your community. No need to say anything specific about a particular bill being considered.

The Ask: “I am your constituent, and I am writing to you to ask you to vote NO on any bill that threatens Medicaid. 

The Personal Story: “I have an adult child with developmental disabilities who relies on Medicaid funds to live semi-independently, and if these funds are cut, I don’t know how I will be able to support him with the level of care he needs.”

### Q: Is there anything I shouldn't say?
A: Please be polite: no profanity, no personal insults (such as calling your representative an idiot), and nothing that could ever be construed as threatening. We aim for respectful constituent letters that tell a compelling story about a particular issue. Herd on the Hill reserves the right to not deliver any letter that includes profanity, personal insults, or threats.

### Q: I know my senator is already going to vote the way I'd like her to. Is it still worth writing?
A: Yes. It's great when you can write a thank-you note to your senator to tell them you appreciate them fighting the good fight and reminding them that their constituents support their position. Too many politicians are scared to do the right thing while they wait for the latest polling numbers to come out. A thank you for something good they have done helps them develop the courage these scary times require.

### Q: There's so much going on that I'm worried about. How often should I write?
A: Aim for one letter every other week, but also take the time to do some outreach and encourage others to write as well. Unified voices are powerful. A single letter coming into a senator’s office is one thing; 300 letters on a topic will make them sit up and take notice.  

### Q: What's this about including a photo?
A: Though it is optional, a photo can also help you tell your story. For example, during the debates on repealing the Affordable Care Act, constituents sent photos of their family members who would be personally affected by repeal. Your photo doesn’t have to be fancy – a selfie will do!

### Q: What should I write about?
A. You should write about what is important to you. Consider the destruction wrought by this regime:
 - Snatching people off the streets and from their workplaces without explanation or legal authority. Shipping people to third countries they have no connection to. 
 - The destruction of health, environmental, and education programs that help countless Americans
 - The cruel and pointless firing of experienced and dedicated federal workers
 - Cuts to Medicaid and SNAP to hand off more tax breaks to the top 1 percent 
 - Lining the Trump family’s pockets with literal billions of dollars through grift, crypto scams, and bribes from foreigners
 - Bullying and threatening our educational institutions, governors, non-profits, and media to bring them to heel
 - An utterly inept tariff “policy” that irrevocably harms US consumers, workers, and companies 
 - Slashing foreign aid that has saved lives and countered the influence of countries like China and Russia 
 - Grossly unqualified cabinet members bungling decades of US authority, reputation, and trust
 - The unlawful occupation of Washington, DC, Los Angeles and other US cities by American troops and tanks
 - Halting renewable energy projects and other climate change initiatives that had already saved billions of dollars and had been helping to blunt the destructive effects of a hotter, drier planet
 - Gutting agencies like FEMA and the National Weather that are critical for responding to emergencies
 - Hiding evidence of Trump’s connections to Jeffrey Epstein
