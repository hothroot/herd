## SENATORS WORK FOR YOU

**Let’s Remind Them!**

“My senator never acknowledges my calls. Aren’t I supposed to get some kind of reply?”

“Whenever I call my elected official, I get a voicemail box that’s full. It feels pointless to call and voice my displeasure if I can’t even leave a message.”

“I saw after the vote on the One Big Beautiful Bill that my senator didn’t even READ it before she voted yes. I am furious! How can I get my anger across?”

“My senator hasn’t held a town hall in four years. What gives?”

Herd on the Hill hears this kind of thing practically every single day. We get it; it’s maddening. And with the nonstop destruction and incompetence coming out of the Executive Branch, we really, really need those in the Legislative Branch - your Senators (and when we have capacity, your members of the House of Representatives) to push back 100 times harder than they have been against Trump’s dangerous policies and executive orders. 

## Where to begin?

Consider the destruction wrought by this regime:
 - Snatching people off the streets and from their workplaces without explanation or legal authority. Shipping people to third countries they have no connection to. 
 - The destruction of health, environmental, and education programs that help countless Americans
 - The cruel and pointless firing of experienced and dedicated federal workers
 - Cuts to Medicaid and SNAP to hand off more tax breaks to the top 1 percent 
 - Lining the Trump family’s pockets with literal billions of dollars through grift, crypto scams, and bribes from foreigners
 - Bullying and threatening our educational institutions, governors, non-profits, and media to bring them to heel
 - An utterly inept tariff “policy” that irrevocably harms US consumers, workers, and companies 
 - Slashing foreign aid that has saved lives and countered the influence of countries like China and Russia 
 - Grossly unqualified cabinet members bungling decades of US authority, reputation, and trust
 - The unlawful occupation of Washington, DC, Los Angeles and other US cities by American troops and tanks
 - Halting renewable energy projects and other climate change initiatives that had already saved billions of dollars and had been helping to blunt the destructive effects of a hotter, drier planet
 - Gutting agencies like FEMA and the National Weather that are critical for responding to emergencies
 - Hiding evidence of Trump’s connections to Jeffrey Epstein
 - And tragically, so much more

## We are Herd on the Hill, and we can help.

We live near Congressional offices. We know our way around Capitol Hill. We amplify your stories. And we understand the power of a constituent letter, phone call, or visit to push Congress to act.
