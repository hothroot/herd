## How It Works

Herd on the Hill volunteers:
- Print letters you write on this website 
- Go to the D.C. offices of your elected officials.
- Hand senators (or their staff) your letters, and talk with them about your concerns
- Facilitate calls with your senator (or their staffers) if you can’t get through on your own
- Help you arrange an on-site visit to your members of Congress

**NOTE: We are a volunteer organization. Current capacity allows us to reach your Senators. We hope that at some future time we can also reach your members of the House of Representatives.**

[Write](/letter)

Write a letter on our website and we will print and hand deliver it to your senator’s D.C. office, engaging with staff, legislative aides and/or the senator her/himself, if possible. 

[Call](/call)

Can't get through on your own by calling the Capitol Switchboard (202-224-3121)? 

Request a live call with your senator’s D.C. office and we can help you get through.

[Visit](/visit)

Want to meet your senator or representative in person if you are visiting D.C.? We can help. 

**ALL OF THESE SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF OUR VOLUNTEERS. Despite a well-worn trope on the right that we are paid by George Soros or some such nonsense, we are regular working people, parents, students, and others who are as devastated by the turn our country has taken as you are. We just happen to live in DC.**

To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin, we can have a republic if we can keep it!
