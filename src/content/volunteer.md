We started Herd on the Hill in February 2017, days after Trump’s first inauguration.

The idea was to tap into DC residents’ proximity to Congressional offices to amplify the voices of those pushing back on the policies being enacted by Republicans, such as multiple attempts to strip away healthcare from millions of Americans by repealing the Affordable Care Act.

Over time, volunteers from outside the District of Columbia got involved by writing letters; coming to Capitol Hill to help deliver letters; and soliciting letters from those in the 50 States. 

The COVID-19 pandemic halted in-person letter deliveries, and the election of President Biden in 2020 meant that we could take a breather from our efforts to combat harmful policies. 

**Now, in the second Trump administration, we are actively recruiting volunteers again.**

Washingtonians: We invite you to use your proximity to congressional offices in D.C. to work around these barriers to get Americans' views directly in front of their elected officials.

**One note: Volunteers decide for themselves whether they want to deliver a particular letter or petition. If the content of the message doesn't align with their own views, they are under no obligation to deliver it. Herd on the Hill is unapologetically anti-Trump and pro-democracy.**
