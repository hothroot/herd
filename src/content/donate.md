Herd on the Hill volunteers are not paid. We give our time and energy out of a desire to fight back against the destructive policies of the current regime. Many of us are also deeply frustrated with our lack of voting representation in Congress.

Last time we checked, the US government is composed of three equal co-branches: the Legislative, the Judiciary, and the Executive. To the horror of millions, the Legislative Branch— Congress—has exhibited a shocking abdication of its responsibility to check and balance the other branches. 

As we fight executive overreach, it is essential that we remind our Senators of their oath to the Constitution, not to any one person. When we deliver letters, arrange phone calls, and show up at Congressional offices, we make Senators uncomfortable, especially when we share their lack of response on our social media pages. We make them and their staff squirm. We put them on notice that if they won’t represent constituents, constituents will replace them with someone who will. 

Your donation will give us the capacity to help more people reach their Members of Congress in D.C. by covering administrative, technology, and legal costs.

Any contribution of any size makes a difference. Thank you!
